Docker compose file for my streaming services

I personally use Poratainer so i just copy/paste the contents of the file, but don't hesitate to contact if you need anything else

My sources are the Trash guide and a bit of my own tinkering and help from community

Trash Guide : https://trash-guides.info/Hardlinks/Hardlinks-and-Instant-Moves/

For the Config of the apps, I'm using a lot of different referecnces, first of all Trash Guide, but also I'm redirecting Radarr and Sonarr directly to Jacket instead of the Indexers through Jacket using This Guide : https://unraid-guides.com/2021/01/17/how-to-add-all-indexers-from-jackett-to-sonarr-and-radarr/

I forgot to put the /data folder to my name so that all the services can read and/or write in the folder (https://www.reddit.com/r/sonarr/comments/rhyiu1/root_folder_not_selecting/)
